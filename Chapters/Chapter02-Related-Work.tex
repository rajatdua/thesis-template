\chapter{Related Work}
\label{cha:related-work}

Whereas the purpose of \autoref{cha:introduction} was to entice and
convince the reader that work reported is interesting, that the author
is asking the right questions about it, and reading about it will be
worthwhile, the purpose of \autoref{cha:related-work} is to
demonstrate that the author possesses a fine overview and keen
understanding of the topic of the work.  Note that while the title of
the chapter is ``Related Work'', it might as well be called
\emph{``Relevant} Work'' in that you should only include work that are
directly useful or relevant to your purpose. 

Writing about others' work can be challenging---it is easy to succumb
to just writing condensed summaries, which are just as tedious to read
as they are to write. A better method is to gain an overview over the
field of inquiry, and then establish in the first section the aspects
or dimensions that are crucial to systems or methodologies such as the
ones described. This demonstrates to the reader that the author has
understanding and judgement. Having done this, every paper or work can
then be described in those established terms. This makes for easier
and much more structured writing, and it also helps the reader
differentiate the systems and works reported on. If there are multiple
works that cover approximately the same area (\eg using the same
technique), you may mention several, but only go into detail with the
most significant or representative one.

The chapter can then be concluded with a table (see
\autoref{tab:relatedwork-summary} on \autopageref{tab:relatedwork-summary})
summarising all the work reported on using the aspects defined in the
introduction of the chapter.

One aspect to keep in mind when reading others' work is how they performed
their evaluation. This can both be a source of inspiration for your own
evaluation in \autoref{cha:evaluation}, and a point of critique, if their
evaluation is weak. It will also often be the case that different papers will
have different kinds of evaluation, making a direct comparison tricky (and
potentially something worth investigating).

A crucial element of this chapter is that it concerns the work of
others and \emph{only} that. While the selection of aspects or
dimensions described above invariantly will reflect your own focus,
that should be the extend of which your own work and plans influence
this chapter.  Your own judgement comes in the next chapter.


\section{A small note on references}
\label{sec:small-note-refer}

It is essential for any scientific work to cite its sources. This can be done
relatively painlessly using \mBibTeX\ as outlined on
\autopageref{sec:handl-bibl}. It is important that you include all necessary
information in the bibliography for others to correctly identify and locate
the referenced work. If you cite one work, it should be done thus
\cite{Kristensen2010:MP2P2010}, if you cite a specific page in a work, it
should be done thus \cite[p. 410]{Chawathe2003:2003}, and if you cite multiple
works, it should be done thus
\cite{knuth:1976,knuth:1974,Kristensen2010:MP2P2010,Mittelbach2004:TLC2004}.
I generally reserve the bibliography for works that have been properly
published and/or peer reviewed. References to Web pages are best handled
through footnotes\footnote{\url{https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/}
  accessed 2018/6/27.}, though some things, such as RFCs and other standard
documents, belong in the bibliography proper. If you use a figure from another
work, you \emph{must} give attribution---otherwise it counts as plagiarism,
which is a serious offence.


\section{Frameworks and Technologies}
\label{sec:fram-techn}

Related work need not only be published academic work. In many cases, it is
also relevant to describe crucial frameworks and technologies that will be
used or are relevant for the thesis.  This does not mean that all employed
technologies should be described in detail, but frameworks and technologies
that are unusual (for lack of a better word) could be described here. \Eg
there is no need to describe an ordinary network stack, but if the work
involves GPU programming, a description of the chosen architecture might well
be relevant, as it informs all the following chapters.  In short, if it is
something a CS generalist should be familar with, there is no need to describe
it.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
As described above, ending the chapter with a figure like
\autoref{tab:relatedwork-summary} summarising the findings can be a great way
to remind the reader of the results, as well as laying the foundation for
\autoref{cha:analysis}.

  \caption[Summary of systems]{The systems and papers described in \autoref{cha:related-work}. The systems have been rated from low to high along the chosen aspects. Note, how this description is very much longer than what appears in the List of Tables. Using both a short and long description is a good idea---it leaves a tidy index and provides rich information where it is needed.}
