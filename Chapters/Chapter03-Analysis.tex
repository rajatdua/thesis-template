This is where the authors can answer the question of what use we can derive
from all the works described in \autoref{cha:related-work}. Ideally, the
summary of the related work will show that there is room unexplored for what
the authors have in mind. If there are differences between the included
works on key aspects in the approach to be taken, this is where this should
be identified, and a decision reached.

It might well be that some decision must be made at this point between one
technical approach versus another, \eg does a particular framework or
technique work for the intended purpose?  These things should be decided
upon before the experimental system can be designed, and this chapter is the
place to do so. Such decisions should be backed by experimental data,
demonstrating one solution's superiority over the others. At other times,
the choice can be made part of the hypotheses stated in
\autoref{sec:what-makes-good}, and then the experiments must be postponed
until the evaluation in \autoref{cha:evaluation}.

Having written the analysis, the authors have all the tools and arguments
needed to complete \autoref{cha:design-and-method}.
